## Demo Workflow

This repository contains two approaches to Cypress test automation for an e-commerce website:

1. Without Page Object Model (POM) ( E-commerce.js)
   ‚û°Ô∏è Direct Cypress test with selectors, actions, and assertions written inside the test.
    * Features: Places an order, validates the cart, applies a promo code, and verifies the final thank-you message.

2. With Page Object Model (POM) ( E-commercePOM.js)
  ‚û°Ô∏è Uses POM structure for better maintainability and reusability.
    * Features: Automates login, product selection, cart validation, checkout, and order confirmation.
