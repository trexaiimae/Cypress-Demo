This repository contains two approaches to Cypress test automation for an e-commerce website:

Without Page Object Model (POM) ‚Äì E-commerce.js

‚û°Ô∏è Direct Cypress test with selectors, actions, and assertions written inside the test.

Features: Places an order, validates the cart, applies a promo code, and verifies the final thank-you message.

With Page Object Model (POM) ‚Äì E-commercePOM.js

‚û°Ô∏è Uses POM structure for better maintainability and reusability.

Features: Automates login, product selection, cart validation, checkout, and order confirmation.
